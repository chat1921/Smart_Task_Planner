**NexPlan AI** is an intelligent task orchestration system that transforms vague user goals into structured, timeline-based execution plans. Unlike simple to-do lists, NexPlan uses **LLM Reasoning (Google Gemini 2.0)** to understand context, estimate duration, and logically sequence dependencies.

## ✨ Advanced Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🧠 **Context-Aware AI** | Utilizes **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** for logical task breakdown and timeline estimation. |
| 🔄 **Conversational Refinement** | **Interactive Mode:** Users can "chat" with the plan to tweak timelines or add missing steps (e.g., *"Make it shorter"*, *"Add budget steps"*). |
| 💾 **Persistent Memory** | **SQLite Database** integration automatically archives projects, allowing instant retrieval of past strategies. |
| 🎨 **Glassmorphism UI** | A premium, dark-mode aesthetic built with Tailwind CSS, featuring staggered animations and responsive design. |
| ⚡ **Real-time Feedback** | Low-latency generation with visual loading states and error handling. |

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), Pydantic (Data Validation)
* **Frontend:** Vanilla JS (ES6+), Tailwind CSS (via CDN), FontAwesome
* **Database:** SQLite (Embedded, Zero-config)
* **AI Engine:** Google Generative AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup Guide

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chat1921/Smart_Task_Planner.git
cd Smart_Task_Planner


This happens when a closing code block tag (```) is missing. Basically, the README thinks you opened a code box for Step 1 but never told it to stop, so it "ate" Step 2, 3, and 4 inside that same box.

Let's fix this directly on GitHub so it looks perfect.
How to Fix it (The Easy Way)

    Go to your GitHub repository page.

    Click on the README.md file.

    Click the tiny Pencil Icon ✏️ (top right of the file view) to edit it.

    Delete everything currently in that box.

    Copy and Paste the code block below. (I have fixed the closing tags so each step is separate).

    Scroll down and click the green Commit changes button.
